                Making friends or getting to know other people is an important part of well-being.
                Sometimes it is hard to make these connections because we are shy, we donâ€™t know
                others or we fear to be ignored, mistreated or laughed at.

                Try to build your social community in small steps one at a time. Pick one social
                goal and try to engage in a social activity in the next few days.
              </p>
              <h5>Tip:</h5>
              <p>
                Spend time with a special family member, a friend, a schoolmate, or someone from the
                church/mosque or prayer group. Sometimes you can meet people from Epilepsy support
                groups, like through the Epilepsy Support Association of Uganda or Purple Bench.
